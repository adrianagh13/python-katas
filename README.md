# Python Katas

## Overview
This project showcases clean and simple solutions for each of the three Python tasks from the EPAM's Cloud & Devops Course. Each solution is implemented in its respective module, focusing on clarity and functionality.

## Kata Descriptions
* Kata 1: Dictionary Class
In this kata a class Dictionary was created, which has methods for adding and looking for specific words, to return their meanings or validating their existence.
* Kata 2: Total Cost Calculation
Contains a function that calculates the total cost of the elements of a shopping list, applies a tax, and returns the value of the total plus the tax, rounded to two decimal places.
* Kata 3: Word Construction
Defines a function that takes an array of words, and constructs a new word, formed by the concatenation of the *nth* letter from each word, where *n* represents the index of the word in the array.

## Structure
A very simple and neat structure was implemented on this small project:
```
python-katas/
|-- kata1.py # Solution for Kata 1: Dictionary Class
|-- kata1.py # Solution for Kata 2: Total Cost Calculation
|-- kata1.py # Solution for Kata 3: Word Construction
|-- main.py # Script to run and demonstrate all katas
|__README.md # Documentation
```

## How To Use
1. Clone the Repository to your local
- Clone the repository and navigate to the recently added directory.
```
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/adrianagh13/python-katas.git
# SSH
git clone git@github.com:adrianagh13/python-katas.git
# Move to the repository
cd python-katas
```
2. Run the Project
- Once ensured that python is installed, run the project using the main.py module.
```
python main.py
```

## Usage Examples
The examples provided on the main.py to test each kata have valid inputs ad indicated in the task instructions, but in addition, validation for handling errors was added.
